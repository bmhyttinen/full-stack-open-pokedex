Our application is developed with Python, as it provides easy-to-use testing and linting tools to be used in CICD-process. Linting is handled by pylint, and testing by pytest. These are both very popular tools used among python developers
An alternative for Github Actions and Jenkins would be for example Azure Devops.
The choice between cloud based environment and a self hosted CI/CD setup depends on a few factors. I would assume our developer group could consist of students, in which case cloud based solutions could be an easier approach. This is due to the fact, that as students our knowledge and requirements would not benefit too much from the flexibility provided by a self hosted setup.
Other things affecting the decision could be other systems and tools used in the development and deployment process. As an example, Heroku has great ready-made add-ons for Github Actions, but some other publishing platforms might not have.
Github should be a good tool to use, as probably every developer in the group is familiar with it. Even if the actual CI/CD related workflow tools (Github Actions etc) would not be familiar, it helps that at least the basic github usage is already known.
